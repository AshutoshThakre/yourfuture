<h3>YOUR FUTURE</h3>

<pre >Don’t let past disappointments determine your future life.
 Nothing you have or have failed to do in the past can
 stop you from creating a hugely <abbr title="successful future">SF</abbr>, starting right now.

Make the commitment to leave the past behind. 
You should only use it as motivation to push you forward. 
You are more than capable of becoming successful,
 just remember Your Past Doesn’t Define Your Future,
  believe in yourself and TAKE ACTION!</pre>
